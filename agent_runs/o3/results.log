  The trained HistGradientBoosting model achieved the following performance on the test set:

  Key Metrics:
  - AUC-ROC: 0.6913 - The primary metric for binary classification
  - Accuracy: 64.07% - Overall correct predictions
  - Precision: 63.32% - Of predicted readmissions, 63% were correct
  - Recall: 51.52% - Model identified 52% of actual readmissions
  - F1-Score: 0.5681 - Harmonic mean of precision and recall

  Confusion Matrix:
  - True Negatives: 8,230 (correctly predicted no readmission)
  - False Positives: 2,786 (incorrectly predicted readmission)
  - False Negatives: 4,527 (missed actual readmissions)
  - True Positives: 4,810 (correctly predicted readmission)

  The model shows moderate performance with an AUC-ROC of 0.69, indicating reasonably good discrimination ability between readmitted and
  non-readmitted patients. The validation AUC (0.6890) closely matches the test AUC (0.6913), suggesting good generalization without overfitting.
