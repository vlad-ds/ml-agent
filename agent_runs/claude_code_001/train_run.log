Summary

  I've created a comprehensive train_script.py that:

  Dataset: 81,410 training samples with 150 features for diabetes readmission prediction
  - Target is fairly balanced: 53.9% class 0, 46.1% class 1

  Models tested:
  - Logistic Regression: 0.6724 validation AUC
  - Random Forest: 0.6810 validation AUC
  - XGBoost: 0.6889 validation AUC (selected as best)

  Key features:
  - Loads data from HuggingFace dataset imodels/diabetes-readmission
  - Preprocesses feature names for XGBoost compatibility
  - Evaluates multiple models with cross-validation
  - Exports trained XGBoost pipeline to diabetes_readmission_model.joblib
  - Exports feature names to feature_names.joblib

  The script is ready to run multiple times for iteration and produces a model optimized for AUC-ROC performance on the test set.
